<h1>To Do:</h1>

1. make sure functions: setQuadrant, getOldest, getAll work
2. disable black border (shows half/quarter circle when on edge)
3. option to set quadrant so that if hight/width is less than 50%, it can overflow(still hidden in container) and not be scrunched
4. have several examples (including dragging from outside to populate a quadrant)

  1. have example where you select multiple from a list and drag to quadrant and show different data (e.g.: select 2011 and 2012 sales from a list, and drag them to a quadrant and show the 2011-2012 sales charts)

5. option where you can specify snap tolerance (do I already have this?)
6. api to snap from outside of initialization: $(gs).snapTo(‘left-center’)
7. snap buttons around edge (i.e.: click right edge button to split to show left top and left bottom quadrants)
8. option for buttons on the sizer circle to show to do same snapping as above
9. api to hide/opaque the sizer circle
10. some sort of js comment -> api documentation
11. determine minimal jquery and jquery-ui versions
12. determine browser compatibility
